# Detection and processing of anomalies in data from drinking water treatment plants

In this repository you will find Python modules, and some C# code from webservices which is used as part of a Master thesis with the same title as this. This repository is used as an extra appendix for code files and the like, which is not as friendly to include in a PDF file.

All commentedout code in the python modules is old code, which is no longer used, but is kept in case we need to revisit the first tests of the thesis.

The C# classes are part of a larger system which is not included here, only the code developed specifically for this thesis, which also means the code are snippets of larget classes, code not written for this have been removed from the respective files.
